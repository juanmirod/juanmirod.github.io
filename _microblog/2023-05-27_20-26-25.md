I like learning with chatgpt, to me it's the best way 
to keep me engaged and focused. I start with a simple
question and keep asking follow ups or doubts
or concerns... this way I am always reading something
that is addressing exactly what I was thinking,
instead of waiting for thw course or the teacher to get to my question or to the content that interests
me.
