I just opened twitter and... Mira Murati also leaves OpenAI: <https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027>

I wonder if all the high management charges that have left OpenAI leave because of great offers outside or because they see that the bankruptcy is imminent... all the talk about GW datacenters, nuclear reactors and trillions in stocks sound to me like the biggest bubble I have ever seen to date, will AI deliver so it doesn't pop?
