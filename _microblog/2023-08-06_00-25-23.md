Great video by Sabine about how we measure intelligence
and how that affects our view of AI. https://youtu.be/T3EHANFeyns

So AI keeps doing more and more tasks, passing more and
more tests and we keep moving the goal posts and saying
"Well but it's not REALLY intelligent because it can't
do THIS THING" the thing sometimes takes some years to
get done by the next AI but recently it's only a matter
of months or even weeks before that happens. Soon we
are going to run out of goalposts to move...
