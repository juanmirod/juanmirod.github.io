A very humbling experience is to read this thread by Terence Tao about GPT-o1: 
https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/113132503432772494

According to him this is on the level or a mediocre graduate student of Maths.
Reading the problems I would say that anyone ho is not at least a Math graduate student
would be completely unable to solve them, even with the books and a whole day to read them
and try to solve the problem. So who good is GPT-o1 at Math? better than 99% of the population?
99.5%? o_O
