Manna presents two possible dystopias of the world with AI, however it presents them as if one is the distopia
and the other one is the utopia.  

> WARNING!!! SPOILERS GALORE

In the dystopia capitalism is taken to the extreme by robots: free labor provided
by the robots turn into a lot of unemployment, and extreme inequalities. The rich control the megacorporations, that control
the government, they pay no taxes and take all the profit, the unemployed live in wellfare, optimized again by more robots...

This dystopia has a lot of holes and doesn't answer a lot of questions, the more important are: why people don't revolve against so much injustice and from where are the rich people taking the profit? capitalism doesn't work if there is no consumers, the book assumes that millions and millions of people live in the robot-controlled wellfare and produce and consume nothing very little, this would make the system collapse at some point, but that is ignored. 

The second dystopia is more or less the same: open source and a master plan by an engineer that buys millions of acres of land
allow to create a society where everyone is equal, robots control the government, the justice system, the infrastructure... pretty much everything and people is free to do whatever they want. BUT: to have that control, robots have turn everybody into
puppets that they can control thought a direct brain connection. They have access to all the nervous system (except the brain) and can even "suspend" a person, taking control of it's body and senses. This is one step away of the brain-in-a-jar distopia where eveyone is just a brain in a jar living in virtual reality... The protagonist doesn't seem to see the problem here and volunteers happily to have the brain connection and, surprise, after all the hurdle, he decides to live in the country side in a retrogade community similar to the Amish where there is no robots and they do everything by themselves (excepts public discourse, democracy or any kind of government) At some point it says that people have a continuous say in the rules of the system, but to me the holes here are too visible: what happens if the robots decide that it's better to put all the brains in jars? what happends if you want to "log out" of the system? There is no free speech, or even free thought because the robots would come for you if you say or do something outside the rules... there is no way to improve the system, appart from "innovation" and "word of mouth..." and then there is the 100% recyclable utopia. Rare earths and lots of alloys are not recyclable, you can't build everything out of silice and geopolitics and trading has to be part of any society. ok, you could say "the robots take care of that" but that's a bit pointless in sci-fi. It should provide at least some hints on how all that works.

To sum up, both dystopias look to me as highly improbable, highly fantastic and unrealistic. it's a pitty, with a better development and 2 or 3 hundred more pages to develop the ideas, it could have been a good book, but it ends up being a reflect of the two current discourses around AI: AI is going to take over everything, we are doomed!! vs AI is going to take over everything, it's going to be great!! (but we are doomed).
